Students are required to develop a monitoring tool that comprises a centralized
server and multiple monitoring agents by integrating all labs. The overall system architecture and data flow of the monitoring tool are illustrated in Figure 1, where:
• Each monitor agent collects data from its localhost then sends to the centralized
server, and also listens for commands from the server both through gRPC.
• Each monitor agent reads and updates its configuration in real time from etcd. The
configuration format should follow the structure shown in Listing 2.
• Students are encouraged to implement various plugins. A typical example is that
monitor agent can prevent data transmission when the new collected data is identical to the previously sent data, thereby reducing network bandwidth usage.
• The centralized server (gRPC server), after receiving monitoring data, forwards it
to Kafka for downstream processing and vice versa. gRPC server takes role as a
broker that transmits data and control signals between Kafka and monitor agents.
• The analysis application reads data from Kafka (produced by the gRPC server),
then print it to stdout. The analysis application also sends commands to Kafka,
which are then forwarded by the gRPC server to the respective agents for execution (dummy commands are enough for demonstration).
